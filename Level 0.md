# Banditgame

## Level 0

Problem: Connect to banditgame via SSH


Hints:

username is bandit0

domain is bandit.labs.overthewire.org

port number is 2220


To solve the ssh into the bandit game using the following format:

ssh [username]@[Domain] -p [Portnumber]


inputting the above details I get the final command:

ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

this will prompt me to enter a password which is also bandit 0
