# Level 3 - Hidden filename

For this level - the file is hidden within the "inhere" directory.

Performing the ls command:

cd into the directory:

Using the ls command for this directory brings me nothing

There are hidden files that the normal ls command doesn't show

so using the -a argument for "all" will display all files, and directories, even hidden ones:

To get to the .Hiding-From-You file the cat command is used - I realised typing ALL dots gets the file:
