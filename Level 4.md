Firstly, I use ls to see what is in the current directory bandit4:

A number of files pop up - and I have to see what file fits the criteria.

Then I use the file command to obtain the file format of the files - ASCII and Unicode are on of the few human-readable file formats.

File 07 is the only human-readable file - however it starts with a dash - symbol.

To obtain the file I have to reference the working directory using ./ once more
