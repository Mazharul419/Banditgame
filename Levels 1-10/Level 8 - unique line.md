For this level I researched the uniq and sort command

The data.txt file looks like this:

This continues for many lines - and it is messy

Using sort I can sort the data.txt file:

This looks neater - however I need to feed this output as the input to the uniq command:

This is what the pipe | symbol does.

For the uniq command the -u option is used to only display unique lines.

Bringing the two commands together results in:

## SUCCESS!!
