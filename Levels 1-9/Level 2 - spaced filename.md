The brief for the level:

The ls command is used to confirm the file exists in the directory:

The cat command is ran to obtain the file - but it fails

This is because the shell interprets text with spaces as seperate files - so will not identify the filename as the whole sentence

To work around this there are 3 solutions I found:
1) Use backslashes \ prior to a space between each word
2) Use double quotation marks "" for the whole sentence
3) Use single quotation marks '' for the whole sentence

Below are each of these respectively:
